			<block><link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainfuck</link><text> is an easy to learn yet complicated to use programming language. Author of the language is Urban MÃ¼ller, who also wrote the first </text><link url="../download/brainfuck.zip">interpreter and compiler for Amiga systems</link><text>. Brainfucked on the other hand is a powerful and efficient brainfuck compiler for Windows and MS-DOS systems.</text></block>

			<block><text>The compiler features an advanced code-optimization and therefore programs created with Brainfucked are quite small. Brainfucked, of course, checks the syntax of brainfuck programs to catch common and possible errors before compiling. It is also capable of compiling programs written for many different platforms such as Windows, DOS, Linux, Unix or Mac OS X. Thus there's virtually no brainfuck program, which Brainfucked can't compile! Every program compiled with Brainfucked is executable under Windows and MS-DOS.</text></block>

			<block><text>The download of Brainfucked includes the compiler itself, its source code, a readme with a brief summary of the brainfuck syntax and some brainfuck examples.</text></block>
